# ElGamal-Basics
This is a very simple implementation of an ElGamal command line tool. You can generate keys as well as sign and verify. This is not completely secure and not meant to be used - just wanted to delve into a bit of cryptography; hence, it is written in python. For details on this project and its security, please refer to the README.
